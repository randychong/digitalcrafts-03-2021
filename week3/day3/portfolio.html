                My name is Randy, and I'm an up-and-coming software developer. For a majority of my career, I've been a customer experience specialist assisting people in need throughtout various situations. I was good at it, but I felt like I needed to continue to learn more which is why I became a developer. My dream is to one day to run my own business, more specifically, my own cafe.
